					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">Electronic portals for procurement are pretty common these days, but it's far less common that the same information available on the website is available as data to be used freely. Even the best performing jurisdictions as far as data availability, don't cover the whole process from tender to contract expiration and evaluation. In fact contract and contractor performance data is much harder to come by than solicitation data, but it can tell us a lot about future procurements. </aside>

					<h2>Benefits of Open Procurement Data</h2>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment" style="margin: 30px 0px;">Attract more diverse bidders</li>
						<li class="fragment" style="margin: 30px 0px;">Better access to prices paid</li>
						<li class="fragment" style="margin: 30px 0px;">Real Strategic Sourcing, More contract vehicles available</li>
						<li class="fragment" style="margin: 30px 0px;">Allows for uninhibited, <strong><em>cheap</em></strong>, third party innovation</li>
						<li class="fragment" style="margin: 30px 0px;">distributed oversight by journalists, the public, other contractors</li>
						<li class="fragment" style="margin: 30px 0px;">Easier to identify bad actors</li>

					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						Often it's difficult to get bids from the most qualified companies, not just the companies most qualified in the bidding process. There's a substantial cottage industry in navigating government procurement. This often works against smaller companies or startups, because they don't have the staff to navigate the process or the capital to pay a middleman. By democritizing access to this information, you can attract bidders that haven't traditionally participated in the process.

						<br /><br />

						Recently we've seen better access to data around purchasing. This has resulted in more municipalities being able to better leverage the purchasing power by cooperating with their neighbors and sharing data on historical purchases.  

						<br /><br />

						Different jurisdictions have been able to share not just what they each paid for the same printer, but also what contract vehicles they're currently operating. Sharing contract vehicles across state or city lines can be especially helpful in cases where something needs to be contracted right away, such as a relief effort. 

						<br /><br />

						All of the benefits I just mentioned require someone to implement them. The good news is that if the data is really open and accessible, someone else will implement it for you. Now that software development is increasingly cheaper and more agile, we've seen a rash of startups making products for procurement. And I have a bunch of examples to show in just a minute. 

						<br /><br />

						In my experience procurement staff are often understaffed and overworked, and this is even more true of the staff in charge of oversight. By making this data more open and accessible, you are distributing that burden across the public, journalists and even other contractors. This makes it more likely that violations will come to light.

						<br /><br />

						It also makes this information easier to share within a single government. Usually, the keepers of the contract data are not the same people who have the data on tax evasion, criminal, environmental, labor, or workplace safety violations. The government should not be rewarding companies that are active violators of the law, even if it's not related to the context of a particular procurement. Of course data from those other departments has to be in reasonable shape as well, but increasing the interoperability of this data is key to making it altogether more useful. 




						-prices paid across jurisdictions, departments (smartprocure, others?)
						-using contract vehicles that already exist in neighboring states, more agile
						-Maybe most important, open data allows third parties to participate in and create products for the procurement process for very little initial cost. This has spurned several businesses dedicated to procurement analytics, RFP creation and response, increasing access, and increasing ease of use.

						These companies are all small start ups, or in the case of RFP-EZ, a startup within government. They can only exist because access to the data is cheap, and doesn't require a huge engineering team to process into a usable format. That is what traditional procurement intelligence firms do. They hire an army of people to sift through the data and produce analytics, when in reality, much of that could be automated if the information were published in a standardized format.

						<li class="fragment" style="margin: 30px 0px;"></li>

						<aside class="notes">The government tends to deal with documents instead of data. However by definition, documents are free form, unstructured and unpredictable in their content. The more structured and consistent your data is, the more useful it is to someone building a product off of it, such as a tender notification application. Having predefined data fields is the difference between being able to notify clients that there's a new solicitation available, versus a solicitation in their industry, for a product they've bid on before, that is targeted towards a small, minority owned business, which they are. </aside>

						<p>The biggest issue users cited is the lack of complete documentation for all of the downloadable data. Many pointed out inaccuracies in the current data dictionary as well as differences between the FPDS dictionary and the USASpending dictionary.</p>
						<p>	Poor data quality was also a big challenge for users. When compared to the CFFR, multiple users reported that USASpending had only 70-80% of what was in the CFFR for the last year the CFFR was produced. Setting aside data quality itself, most users suggested that reporting data quality or compliance metrics would help them manage expectations with their products and give them more confidence in the data.</p>
						<p>Aggregating data by entity was a very common task that everyone wanted to be able to do. Based on the current data, this isn't possible to do accurately via the data or website. </p>
						<p>Most users have in-depth questions about the data that are not answered by the site's FAQ. The lack of contact information or response from the site contact form has been very frustrating for them</p>

					<h3>The Proposal:</h3>

					</div>
					<aside class="notes">I propose that the GAT board is in a good position to convene these kinds of users and the producers of the spending data in one place to address some of these challenges. Since the GAT board is responsible for strategic direction, it can set a precedent by engaging the community in the same way the Recovery board has in the past. It could be framed as a meeting, mini-conference or a development sprint where attendees work together to create documentation, tutorials, primers and tools for the data.</aside>

						<li>After hours social meetups</li>
						<li>Day-long mini-conference</li>
						<li>Development/Documentation sprint</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes"><p>There are a lot of variations this could take. It could be an ongoing series, like a set of social meetups or roundtables. It could be a one time event like a mini conference that kicks off a broader discussion that can take place online. Or it could be a bit more collaborative like a development sprint.</p>
					<p>In software development, people sprint for days on documentation alone. This community has a good enough working knowledge of the data that it could be a great resource for helping to create and distribute documentation, tutorials and guides for using this data.This community wants to help itself, but they need some level of access to the experts. </p></aside>

					<h3>Potential Outcomes</h3>
					<ul class="left">
						<li>Knowledge sharing with those most likely to disseminate</li>
						<li>Community driven documentation</li>
						<li>Guides, tutorials, data dictionaries on using the data and the site search</li>
						<li>Tools for users and the USASpending team</li>
						<li>The beginning of an online home for the federal spending data community</li>
						<li>More informed discussions of spending transparency priorities</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">Here's a list of some possibilities that could results from this. Documentation that is driven by and serves the community. Collaborative guides on how to use the data. Tools for users. Maybe you have some programmers who attend who write a script to parse all the address fields and convert them to lat/long. Or maybe they create a Q&amp;A site like Stack Exchange to host discussion about the data. </aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3 class="left">Potential Discussion Questions</h3>
					<ul class="left">
						<li>When to use different downloadable data</li>
						<li>How to link contractors to subcontractors</li>
						<li>What are differences b/w USASpending and FPDS</li>
						<li>How to increase public interest in spending transparency</li>
						<li>How users can submit data cleaning/fixes back to USASpending</li>
						<li>What are requirements for agency reporting, exceptions?</li>
						<li>How the data is generated?</li>
						<li>Differences between the CFFR and FAADS PLUS data</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">Now, I know that sometimes the requests of the transparency community can be a little all over the map. But the self identified data geeks I surveyed have very specific, practical questions that relate directly to their application. Answers to these kinds of questions are very achievable and go a long way towards building trust and credibility with this community so everyone is operating in good faith as we work toward a common goal.	</aside>
