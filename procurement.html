					<aside class="notes">Ok so that's me and who I'm representing. Let's talk about Open Data broadly. These four attributes pretty much describe it in the broadest sense.
						<br />
						Anybody can use it for basically any purpose. <br /><br />
						Readily available (preferably via the internet) and in a format conducive to data, such as a spreadsheet or database, NOT PDF or word documents). Not conducive to data, licensing restrictions on formats <br /><br />
						There are no licenses required to use or redistribute the data <br /><br />
						Also, does not require a log in or account to access data (I'm looking at you TED).</aside>

					<ul>
						<li class="fragment" style="margin: 30px 0px;">Often available via a website, not as regularly updated data</li>
						<li class="fragment" style="margin: 30px 0px;">Piecemail, not comprehensive</li>
						<li class="fragment" style="margin: 30px 0px;">Lack of good data on contract performance is widespread</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">Electronic portals for procurement are pretty common these days, but it's far less common that the same information available on the website is available as data to be used freely. Even the best performing jurisdictions as far as data availability, don't cover the whole process from tender to contract expiration and evaluation. In fact contract and contractor performance data is much harder to come by than solicitation data, but it can tell us a lot about future procurements. </aside>

				<section>
					<h2>Benefits of Open Procurement Data</h2>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment" style="margin: 30px 0px;">Attract more diverse bidders</li>
						<li class="fragment" style="margin: 30px 0px;">Better access to prices paid</li>
						<li class="fragment" style="margin: 30px 0px;">Real strategic sourcing, More contract vehicles available</li>
						<li class="fragment" style="margin: 30px 0px;">Allows for uninhibited, <strong><em>cheap</em></strong>, third party innovation</li>
						<li class="fragment" style="margin: 30px 0px;">distributed oversight by journalists, the public, other contractors</li>
						<li class="fragment" style="margin: 30px 0px;">Easier to identify bad actors</li>

					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						Often it's difficult to get bids from the most qualified companies, not just the companies most qualified in the bidding process. There's a substantial cottage industry in navigating government procurement. This often works against smaller companies or startups, because they don't have the staff to navigate the process or the capital to pay a middleman. By democritizing access to this information, you can attract bidders that haven't traditionally participated in the process.

						<br /><br />

						Recently we've seen better access to data around purchasing. This has resulted in more municipalities being able to better leverage the purchasing power by cooperating with their neighbors and sharing data on historical purchases.  

						<br /><br />

						Different jurisdictions have been able to share not just what they each paid for the same printer, but also what contract vehicles they're currently operating. Sharing contract vehicles across state or city lines can be especially helpful in cases where something needs to be contracted right away, such as a relief effort. 

						<br /><br />

						All of the benefits I just mentioned require someone to implement them. The good news is that if the data is really open and accessible, someone else will implement it for you. Now that software development is increasingly cheaper and more agile, we've seen a rash of startups making products for procurement. And I have a bunch of examples to show in just a minute. 

						<br /><br />

						In my experience procurement staff are often understaffed and overworked, and this is even more true of the staff in charge of oversight. By making this data more open and accessible, you are distributing that burden across the public, journalists and even other contractors. This makes it more likely that violations will come to light.

						<br /><br />

						It also makes this information easier to share within a single government. Usually, the keepers of the contract data are not the same people who have the data on tax evasion, criminal, environmental, labor, or workplace safety violations. The government should not be rewarding companies that are active violators of the law, even if it's not related to the context of a particular procurement. Of course data from those other departments has to be in reasonable shape as well, but increasing the interoperability of this data is key to making it altogether more useful.

					<aside class="notes">
						All these organizations are all small start ups. They can only exist because access to the data is cheap, and doesn't require a huge engineering team to process into a usable format. That is what traditional procurement intelligence firms do. They hire an army of people to sift through the data and produce analytics, when in reality, much of that could be automated if the information were published in a standardized format. This makes these analytical products cheaper, and more accessible to companies with less capital.  
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2 style="margin-top:-300px;">Attributes of Good Data</h2>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment" style="margin: 30px 0px;">Timely notices as data, not documents</li>
						<li class="fragment" style="margin: 30px 0px;">Data publishing is on a reliable, predictable schedule</li>
						<li class="fragment" style="margin: 30px 0px;">Using standard definitions and vocabulary (CPV)</li>
						<li class="fragment" style="margin: 30px 0px;">Documenting the data</li>

						<aside class="notes">So what specific attributes of the data make these kind of products possible? The government tends to deal with documents instead of data. However, documents are free form, unstructured and unpredictable in their content. The more structured and consistent your data is, the more useful it is to someone building a product off of it. 
						<br /><br />
							Having predefined data fields is the difference between an application being able to notify clients that there's a new solicitation available, versus notifying them that there's a solicitation in their industry, for a product they've bid on before, that is targeted towards a small business. Having a predefined structure to your data allows for a richness of context that isn't otherwise possible. 
						<br /><br />
						So these are a few things that will help with that. Firstly, releasing the data in a timely fashion so that it's always current. Also, releasing that data on a regular, predictable schedule will make it easier for businesses to use it in a product because they'll have confidence it won't suddenly become unavailable. 
						<br /><br />
						Using identifiers and data descriptors that are cross jursidictional is also really helpful. The common procurement vocabulary is a good example of this. Lastly, just making sure you create a data dictionary for your data so that people can actually understand what it means.

					<aside class="notes">
						So we've established that open data can be used for lots of things to make the market around procurement more efficient. Now I want to talk about one of the least transparent aspects of procurement data and what I think should be the future of open procurement data.
						
					<br /><br />
					Earlier I mentioned contractor performance data and how it's not available in many places, at least publicly. This is a problem because in a lot of the scenarios I've seen, not only do governments generally not have enough procurement staff to keep up with most of their procurements, but the oversight staff for those procurements is even thinner. And it's very difficult for governments to learn from others' mistakes. One example of this is Healthcare.gov, an extremely public procurement failure in the US.

				<section data-background="/images/healthcare_crash.png">
					
					<aside class="notes">Late last year the federal government launched a website so that everyone in America could finally sign up and get health insurance, regardless of employment status. The website was immediately crippled by the web traffic it received on its first day and it took months to fix. The main contractor working on the site was CGI Federal.
					<br /><br />
					What most people didn't know at the time was that CGI Federal had previously failed at implementing similar large scale data systems, including a Tax Collection system for the state of North Carolina, similar health exchanges for the states of Vermont and Massachussetts, and also the federal thrift savings plan, which is essentially the retirement savings plan for all federal employees. Despite a very poor record, CGI federal continued to get contracts.

					<br /><br />
					This happened for two main reasons. The unavailability of this information across jurisdictions, due to confidentiality contracts or just lack of data collected, and the rebranding of CGI Federal, which was formerly known as AMS. AMS was actually known specifically to the federal government as a poor performing contractor on the thrift savings plan. Had the federal government been able to accurately detect that AMS had been purchased by CGI Group and rebranded as CGI Federal, they might have selected a more qualified contractor. 

					<br />
					<br />
					So the problem was two-fold. The lack of information sharing severely limited the ability of the contracting officers to properly vet this contractor. Had the information been public, competing contractors with better records might have noticed this during the awarding of the contract and filed a bid protest. 

					 </aside>

				<section>
					<h2>Why Couldn't They Detect the Change?</h2>

					<aside class="notes">
						Something that affects a lot more than procurement is the general inability to track corporate ownership structures over time. This also has implications for money laundering, patent ownership, and financial markets. There are a few proprietary solutions out there from business intelligence firms, but they fall short in areas of reliability and cost-effectiveness. 
						<br />
						<br />
						The main problem is that companies and subsidiaries can often have very similar names and how they're legally related is not always obvious from the name. Having a unique identifier for companies, regardless of whether or not they change their doing business as name, is critical to providing procurement oversight, and making sure that company's past performance stays with them.  
					</aside>
				</section>	

				<section data-background="images/openleis.png">
					<aside class="notes">One effort in this area that I want to highlight is the Global Legal Entity Identifier. This effort by the G8 countries and the Financial Stability Board is just getting off the ground but has already made some great progress. It was created to help systematically identify risk in financial markets in the wake of the financial crisis. So if I am Goldman Sachs and I'm buying parts of Lehman Brothers, what other entities do they own and what potentially risky assets do those entities own? Because these ownership networks are so immensely complicated, they need an automated way of resolving the relationships.
					<br /><br />
					On the slide is Openleis.com which is one of the web portals where you can view and interact with these ids. The commodity futures trading commission in the US is already issuing these ids, as well as several other issuers around the world. I'd encourage anyone in charge of procurement to seriously consider this effort as a way to register and track potential contractors.
